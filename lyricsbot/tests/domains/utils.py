EXPECTED_LYRICSONDEMAND = """Daylight, I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I usually know but now, that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hoverboard like that, but no wrong
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, aah!

But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Put your hands up on me
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes
But stay woke, ooh
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

Baby get so scandalous, oh
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, oh
Baby you
How'd it get...
How'd it get so scandalous?
Ooh we get so scandalous
But stay woke
But stay woke"""

EXPECTED_SONGLYRICS = """The looking glass, so shiny and new
How quickly the glamor fades
I start spinning slipping out of time
Was that the wrong pill to take?

Raise it up
You made a deal and now
It seems you have to offer up
But will it ever be enough?

Raise it up
Raise it up
It's not enough
Raise it up
Raise it up

Here I am, a rabbit hearted girl
Frozen in the headlights
It seems I made the final sacrifice

We raise it up
This offering
We raise it up

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

I look around but I can't find you
Raise it up
If only I could see your face
Raise it up

I started rushing towards the starlight
Raise it up
I wish that I could just be brave

I must become the lion hearted girl
Ready for a fight
Before I make the final sacrifice

We raise it up
This offering
We raise it up

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

Raise it up
Raise it up
Raise it up
Raise it up

And in the spring I shed my skin
And it blows away with the changing wind
The water has turned from blue to red
As towards the sky I offer it

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
And Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight
This is a gift"""
