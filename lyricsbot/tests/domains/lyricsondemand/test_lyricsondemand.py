I usually know but now, that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hoverboard like that, but no wrong
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it

Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, aah!

Put your hands up on me
